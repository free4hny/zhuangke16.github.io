								<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The idea came from the problem that in this modern society, a lot of people are living in such micro spaces, like offices separated by partitions, but they donâ€™t have enough energy or time to notice the uniqueness of their living environment. The project can help them be aware of their environment conditions without spending time on observing.</br></br>
								  We use four parts to solve the problem: a hardware terminal to collect data, a cloud server to transfer data, a mobile app to display the results and a database to save the data for analysis. It is an intelligent terminal that can monitor the space of a relatively small space in real time and remind users to change the current space when the environment is not suitable. Modular design helps the project meet someone's individual requirements and regression algorithm helps it understand users better.</p>

				</br></br></br><h4>Design Process</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">After reading the requirements of this assignment, I summarized functional and non-functional requirements for my project. </br></br></p>
				<h5>Functional Requirements:</h5>
				<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">1. A map drawn with the area (streets and pumps) including the locations of the deaths.</br>2. A timeline graph showing the number of deaths per day.</br>3. Ability to move the mouse over the timeline graph to choose which day to visualize.</br>4. Details on who wrote the project, where the data came from, etc.</br>5. Label 5 major street names and the location of the brewery and the work house.</br>6. Show on the map whether each victim was male or female.</br>7. Show on the map the age of each victim.</br>8. A graph shows the distribution of deaths by gender and age overall.</br>9. Ability to visualize the overall graph (including gender and age) with the change of date.</br>10. Zoom in/out and pan around the map.</br></br></p>
				<h5>Non-Functional Requirements:</h5>
				<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">1. Stable graph and map.</br>2. Well labeled graph and map.</br>3. Friendly to people with color blindness.</br>4. Update quickly when the user interacts.</br>5. Gender and age for each victim should be seen easily.</br>6. Show data clearly.</br>7. Do not confuse the user.</br></br></br></p>

				<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">According to those requirements, I processed to design my project. Initially, I just came up with the sketch of the map without adding colors. With the project going on, I draw 2 sketches to help me modify the design.</p>

				<table><tr>
				<td><img class="img-responsive" src="img/7.png" alt="Featured Image"></td>
				<td><img class="img-responsive" src="img/8.png" alt="Featured Image"></td>				
				</tr></table>

				<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">First, I wanted to make block for each graph(the left photo), however, when I finished drawing the map, I found that it cannot be small enough to be placed in one block, so I rearranged the structure into the sketch on the right side. Finally when I implemented the visualization, the layout is slightly different from this one.</br></br></br></p>

				<h4>Design Choices</h4><p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">When I began to choose which color to use, first I used color pencils to record some initial thinking. But they are just the first thought came into my mind, and the color shown on screen is quite different from that on the paper.</br></p>
				<div align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/6.png" alt="Featured Image" width="400" ></div>
				<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"></br></br>I began to choose color at the same time when I began coding and tried different plans on my page. </br></p>
				<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">First, I choose to fill the circles white with black stokes because when they enter the page, there is no color shows the gender or age of the victim. The combination of black and white looks like a graffiti board indicates there are colors needed to be filled in.</p>
				<div align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/5.png" alt="Featured Image" width="500" ></div>

				</br><p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">I tried different ways to show the gender during the process of the project, but the combination of colors (steel blue and orange) did not change because they can be distinguished easily. and by comparing them I choose the one that shows the clearest data (the 3rd one).</p>
				<table><tr>
				<td><img class="img-responsive" src="img/2.png" alt="Featured Image"></td>
				<td><img class="img-responsive" src="img/3.png" alt="Featured Image"></td>	
				<td><img class="img-responsive" src="img/4.png" alt="Featured Image"></td>			
				</tr></table>

					</br><p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">When I chose which color to use to show the age of the victim, I thought that age changes gradually so that I want to use colors which also change gradually. But when implement it on the map, those colors cannot be easily distinguished. When using the blindness tool, it is harder to distinguish. Then with the help of Color Brewer, I finally choose to use the 2nd combination.</p>

				<table><tr>
				<td><img class="img-responsive" src="img/1.png" alt="Featured Image" width="500"></td>
				<td><img class="img-responsive" src="img/9.png" alt="Featured Image" width="500"></td>	
				<td><img class="img-responsive" src="img/10.png" alt="Featured Image" width="80"></td>	
				</tr></table>

				</br><p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">I made the range of the Y axis changes with the data because I found that when there is only one victim, it's hard to see it if the range is more than 80. So I made the range of the Y axis equals to the maximum data shown in the graph.</p>

				<table><tr>
				<td><img class="img-responsive" src="img/12.png" alt="Featured Image" ></td>
				<td><img class="img-responsive" src="img/13.png" alt="Featured Image" ></td>	
				<td><img class="img-responsive" src="img/11.png" alt="Featured Image" ></td>			
				</tr></table>

				</br></br><h4>Discovered facts</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">According to US census data from 1850, percentage of people in each age group in general during that time were 0-10: 28%, 11-20: 25%, 21-40: 30%, 41-60: 13%, 61-80: 4%, > 80: 1%. We assume the same breakdown for London. But during this cholera epidemic, the largest number of victims are from the age group: >80. So, this epidemic may be harmful for olds and they have the lowest survival rate.</p>
				<div align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/11.png" alt="Featured Image" width="350" ></div>
				<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">Also, there is not large difference among the percentages of people in age 0-10, 11-20 and 21-40, however, in age 0-10, the number of victims is nearly twice as much as those in the other two groups, so kids are easier to suffer in this disease.</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">There are not so many differences between number of victims of males and that of females, so the disease may not related to gender.</p></br></br>
				<div align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/14.png" alt="Featured Image" width="350" ></div>
				<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">From the timeline we can see that the peak is on September 1st, and the epidemic outbreaked during August 31st to September 10th. Actually the number of deaths increaces for only 2 days. If some measures were used to control this epidemic, it is quite efficient.</p></br></br>
				<table><tr>
				<td><img class="img-responsive" src="img/15.png" alt="Featured Image" ></td>
				<td><img class="img-responsive" src="img/16.png" alt="Featured Image" ></td>	
				</tr></table>
				<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The left graph above is the locations of deaths by August 27th, and the right one is by 3rd September. We can see that new deaths happened around the original deaths. And pumps may also be the way for spreading of the epidemic. This disease may spread through water and the contaction with the infected person.</p>
